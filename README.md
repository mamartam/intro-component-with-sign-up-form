# Intro component with sign up form
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 — semantic markup for form structure and layout
- CSS3 — responsive design using Flexbox and Grid, custom properties (CSS variables), and media queries
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS) — client-side form validation, DOM manipulation, and event handling
- Regular Expressions (RegEx) — email format validation
- Mobile-first workflow — layout optimized for mobile and larger screens
- Git & GitHub — version control and project hosting

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to build and style a responsive form layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid
- How to validate form inputs on the client side using JavaScript
- How to work with DOM elements and handle user events (submit, blur)
- How to show and hide error messages dynamically using CSS classes
- How to use Regular Expressions (RegEx) to validate email input
- How to prevent default form submission behavior and control form logic with JavaScript

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved
- Add more advanced validation rules (minimum password length, only letters for name fields, stronger email validation)
- Display real-time validation while typing instead of only on blur
- Improve accessibility by adding full keyboard navigation and better screen reader support
- Replace alert messages with custom success messages inside the UI
- Add smooth animations for error messages and input states
- Save submitted data using localStorage for better user experience
